### Create new repository with Event Portal GitHub Actions
1. Make sure you are logged into GitHub and go to the [Import Existing Repository page](https://github.com/new/import). 
2. Use `https://github.com/TamimiGitHub/ep-asyncspec-workflow.git` for the URL, list yourself as the owner, and name the new repository `customer360`. Click on **Begin Import**.
3. Wait for the import to complete, usually around 3 minutes. Then click on the link to open the repository.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Cloning through GitHub occasionally takes a bit of time. After 3 minutes, try refreshing the page to see if it's done.
